# Windows-Exploit-Downloader
A simple script that recursively downloads exploits for a windows system. 
This is a script that takes output from wes-ng: https://github.com/bitsadmin/wesng. 
It then extracts EDB-ID's from the output and recursively downloads them with searchsploit: https://github.com/offensive-security/exploitdb.
Given that you can execute the systeminfo command in windows and capture the output you can plug it into wes.py
The way this script should be used is in the directory with the output that was captured from wes-ng.
For example:

It's good for privilege escalation and saves some keystrokes if you're trying to load compatible exploits in one place.
The only requirements are that you have a linux system with searchsploit and your wes-ng output file.  
You can alternatively use the output of any other exploit suggester that gives you a list of exploit database URL's.
