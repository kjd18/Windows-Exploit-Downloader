# Windows-Exploit-Downloader
A simple script that recursively downloads exploits for a windows system. 
This is a script that takes output from wes-ng: https://github.com/bitsadmin/wesng. 
It then extracts EDB-ID's from the output and recursively downloads them with searchsploit.
Given that you can execute the systeminfo command in windows and capture the output you can plug it into wes.py
The way this script should be used is in the directory with the output that was captured from wes-ng.
For example:
